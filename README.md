Welcome to CD Records!

I'm a huge fan of music and I wanted to make a project around music.
Let me present you CD Records, a music studio that can help customers to record albums, or double movies, etc.
It's a showcase website that presents the studio's offers, allows users to contact the studio via a contact form and presents the members.

I made this project in order to:
    - Realize a showcase project,
    - Highlight my skills in Vue.js and SCSS (using conditions, the 'for' loop, mixin for a better code architecture),
    - Challenge myself on the project management:
        - I created a Trello to assign myself tickets
        - I fixed and respected deadlines to finish the project
        
I hope you'll enjoy the project!
